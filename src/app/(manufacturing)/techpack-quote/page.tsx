          Giving Quote for creative design and preparing tech packs is quite
          difficult to standardize. Designers rarely provide price estimates for
          services unless they figure out the detailed requirement and number of
          hours they need to accomplish the job. I completely agree with this
          way of doing business yet I am an old player in the field of technical
          design and I also appreciate a price tag on items. I believe that by
          providing quick estimates for my most popular services it simply helps
          people become better consumers. In that vein, below you will see
          general estimates for services. This quote is for those who provide me
          with a long term and sustained design and tech pack development
          service and has its minimum styles requirements
